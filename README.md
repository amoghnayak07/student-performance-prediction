# Overview

This project uses Linear Regression to predict student performace based on various factors. The goal is to explore how different features affect students' scores and to build a predictive model.

# Dataset Information

- The dataset used: `Student_Performance.csv`
- Features include:
  - Hours Studied
  - Previous Exam Scores
  - Extracurricular Activies: Boolean Values
  - Number of hours slept
  - Sample Question Papers Practiced
  - Perfomance Index

# How to Run the Project

```
git clone <repo-link>
cd student-performance-prediction
jupyter notebook
```

# Model an Results

- The model uses Linear Regression to predict student performance.
- Performance Metrics: <b>R-squared Score</b>
